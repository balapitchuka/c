1.Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time complexity is O(Logn).

2.Given number of digits n in a number, print all n-digit numbers whose digits are strictly increasing from left to right.

3.Write a program to print all permutations of a given string without  repeations.

4.Given a sorted array in which all elements appear twice (one after one) and one element appears only once. Find that element in O(log n) complexity.

5.Given an array that represents elements of arithmetic progression in order. One element is missing in the progression, find the missing number.o(logn)

6.calculate all numbers sum present in a string.
